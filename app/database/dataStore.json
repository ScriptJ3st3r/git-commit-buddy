        "fileName: AccountService.ts commitMessage: The provided code is a Node.js application that appears to be part of an authentication system. It includes several methods for handling user registration, password reset, and logout.  Here are some suggestions for improving the code:  1. **Consistent naming conventions**: The code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable names. It's best to stick with a single convention throughout the application. 2. **Error handling**: While the code catches errors in some places, it doesn't provide much information about what went wrong. Consider adding more specific error messages or logging to help diagnose issues. 3. **Code organization**: The code is quite long and does several unrelated tasks. Consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused functions or classes. 4. **Security**: Some parts of the code, such as password hashing and verification, use insecure methods (e.g., `bcrypt.hash()` with a fixed salt). Make sure to use secure libraries like `bcryptjs` and follow best practices for password storage. 5. **Type annotations**: The code doesn't include type annotations for function parameters or return types. Consider adding these to improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.  Here's an updated version of the `resetPassword` method that addresses some of these suggestions: ```javascript async resetPassword(body: { username: string; password: string }) {   try {     const { username, password } = body;      logger.info(`Resetting password for user ${username}`);      const record = await this.uUser.findOne({ where: { email: username } });      if (!record) {       throw new Error('No user found with the specified username');     }      await AppDataSource.manager.transaction(async (transaction) => {       const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);       await transaction.createQueryBuilder()         .update(User)         .set({ password: hashedPassword })         .where(\"id = :id\", { id: record.id })         .andWhere(\"email = :email\", { email: username })         .execute();        await this.resetRepo.delete({ email: username });        logger.info(`Password successfully reset for user ${username}`);     });      return {       status: 200,       message: 'Your password has been successfully reset.',       redirectUrl: '/account/login',     };   } catch (error) {     logger.error(`Error resetting password: ${error.message}`);     throw error;   } } ``` Note that I've added type annotations, improved error handling, and used a more secure method for password hashing.",

        "fileName: branchOrderSubmitted.ejs commitMessage: The provided code is a web application written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It appears to be a part of an e-commerce or inventory management system. The code is quite extensive and covers various aspects such as user authentication, order management, and data retrieval.  Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:  1. **Code organization**: The code is not well-organized, with many functions and variables scattered throughout the file. Consider breaking it down into separate files or modules to improve maintainability. 2. **Variable naming**: Some variable names are not descriptive enough (e.g., `id`, `type`, `row`). Consider using more descriptive names to improve readability. 3. **Functionality**: The code has many functions that perform similar tasks (e.g., `onSubmitOrder` and `onProcessOrder`). Consider extracting common functionality into separate functions or classes to reduce duplication. 4. **Security**: The code uses `fetchJsonData` and `submitJsonData_` functions, which are not shown in the provided code snippet. Ensure that these functions handle errors and exceptions properly to prevent security vulnerabilities. 5. **Error handling**: The code does not have robust error handling mechanisms. Consider adding try-catch blocks or error handlers to handle potential errors and provide meaningful feedback to users. 6. **Code style**: The code uses inconsistent indentation (e.g., some lines are indented with 4 spaces, while others use 2). Consider using a consistent coding style throughout the file. 7. **Comments**: The code lacks comments, making it difficult for other developers to understand its functionality and logic. Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each function or section of code.  To address these issues, consider refactoring the code into smaller, more manageable pieces, and add descriptive variable names, error handling mechanisms, and comments to improve readability and maintainability.  Here's an example of how you could refactor the `onSubmitOrder` function: ```javascript function processOrder() {   const orderData = {     destinationBranch: destination,     id: currentOrder,     orderStatus: 'Submitted'   };    try {     submitJsonData('/api/branch-orders/submit', orderData, 'PUT', 'Are you sure, you want to submit this order?');   } catch (error) {     showToast('Error submitting order:', 'error');   } } ``` Similarly, consider refactoring the `onProcessOrder` function: ```javascript function processOrder() {   const orderData = {     srcBranch: source,     destBranch: destination,     orderId: currentOrder   };    try {     submitJsonData_('/api/branch-orders/process', orderData, 'PUT', 'Are you sure, you want to process this order?');   } catch (error) {     showToast('Error processing order:', 'error');   } } ``` By refactoring the code in this way, you can improve its maintainability, readability, and error handling capabilities.",
